# CodSoft_To_Do_List
Welcome to the **To-Do List Application**! This project showcases the integration of **voice recognition**, task management, and **machine learning** techniques to enhance productivity. Developed as part of my internship at **CodSoft**, this application allows users to efficiently manage their tasks through a user-friendly interface.

The To-Do List Application includes several key features that enhance user experience. Users can add tasks simply by speaking, thanks to the voice recognition capabilities powered by the **SpeechRecognition library**. For those who prefer manual entry, the application also supports adding tasks through a simple input prompt. Once tasks are added, users can easily view all their tasks along with deadlines, providing a clear overview of pending work. Additionally, the application employs **KMeans clustering** from the **scikit-learn library** to prioritize tasks based on their descriptions. This feature helps users focus on the most important tasks, improving overall productivity.

To run this application, you will need to install several Python libraries, including **SpeechRecognition**, **PyAudio** (for voice input), and **scikit-learn**. You can install the required packages using pip with the command **pip install SpeechRecognition PyAudio scikit-learn.**

To get started, clone this repository or download the code files. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code files are located. You can run the application using the command python todo_list.py, and then follow the prompts in the application to manage your tasks.

The application menu allows users to choose from several options: selecting **1** to add a task using voice input, **2** to add a task manually, **3** to display all tasks and their deadlines, **4** to prioritize tasks based on their descriptions, and **5** to exit the application.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and contribute to further improvements.
